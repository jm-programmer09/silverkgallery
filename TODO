- make the our collection bit have a hover that allows users to already select certain sections - like on acme
- have a row element on the "the engine of imagination"
- fix the fly-in animations for mobile
- have a button under the paragraph for the piece of the week of the button saying 'find more from walt disney'
- have an arrow come out of the explore our collection button
- then have a list in the collections, where featured animation and featured photography is a selector
- have an arrow that appears to take you back to the top of the page if the user scrolls far enough
- change the first thing you see on the home page to just be one big image when it is on the mobile device and then potentially on the desktop i can have it so the big image flicks in and out with different images
